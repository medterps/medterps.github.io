            Be sure to know how to interpret the names of the common viruses and the large variety of respiratory symptoms they cause.<br><br>
            Flu - gripe/influenza<br>Respiratory sincytial virus - virus sincitial respiratorio<br>Bronchiolitis - bronquiolitis<br>Rhynovirus- rinovirus<br>Adenovirus - adenovirus<br>
            Croup - crup<br>Wheezing - silbido<br>Stridor - estridor <br>Dry cough - tos seca<br>Productive cough - tos productiva (commonly called tos con flemas)<br>Crackling - sonido crepitante
            <br>Shortness of breath - falta de aire<br>Difficulty breathing - dificultad al respirar
        </p>

            Try to use the same tone as the patient/provider. Tone has a major influence on the meaning of a message and the flow of conversation.
            A calm statement interpreted with an angry tone by the interpreter can change the course of the encounter for the worst.<br><br>
            Takeaway: if the patient or provider is angry/sad/worried/bored/excited etc. then carry their tone over into your interpretation.
            That is the message they want to deliver so its the message that we have to interpret; its not up to us to decide what components the message will have.

            Insurance is unfortunately an enormous part of healthcare in the U.S. so as interpreters we spend a lot of time talking about it.<br>
            Thankfully there are a few key terms you can learn to make these encounters a bit less exhausting.<br><br>
            Deductible - deducible <br>Premium - mensualidad <br>Copay - copago <br>Group number - n&#250mero de grupo <br>Policy number- n&#250mero de p&#243liza <br>Claim - reclamo <br>Appeal - apelar v. Apelaci&#243n n
            <br><br>I say bill as factura by default but sometimes I use bil if the patient seems more comfortable using it.

            Natural killer cells are a type of lymphocyte or white blood cell that kills invading organisms such as bacteria, virus, and tumors.<br />
            There are a few ways to interpret natural killer cells: células asesinas naturales, células asesinas, y a veces células NK (por sus siglas en ingles).
        </p>
        <p>
            Linguee is an excellent site for looking up terms. It is a database of documents that have been translated and when you search a term it shows you the most common translations of the term in the database.<br />
            It is very spot on, and it tends to give you not only more accurate translations but also a wider variety of possible translations than other dictionary programs.<br />
            I have it downloaded on my phone and I have the Spanish/English dictionary downloaded for offline use.

            The heart pumps blood through the left ventricle into the aorta which brings it to the rest of the body. <br />Normally the heart pumps out the majority of the blood in the left ventricle in order to supply oxygen rich blood to the body. When the heart is too rigid to fill fully with blood or too weak or damaged to pump blood the blood flow to the every part of the body is reduced. This is called heart failure, or cardiac insufficiency.<br />

            The amount of blood pushed out or ejected is measured as a percentage called the ejection factor. For example an ejection factor of 75 means that 75 percent of the blood is pumped out of the left ventricle with each beat. An ejection factor of 25 means that only a fourth of the blood is being pumped out. An ejection factor of 50-55 is generally considered borderline, and under 50 heart failure begins.<br />

            In Spanish the terms are fallo cardíaco o insuficiencia cardíaca, and factor de eyección.<br />
            Ventricle is ventrículo and aorta is the same
        </p>

            Methotrexate, vincristine, mercaptopurine, and prednisone are some of the medicines used during the maintenance phase of treatment for acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL).<br />
            In Spanish these medicines are metotrexato, vincristina, mercaptopurina, y prednisona. La fase se dice fase de mantenimiento y la enfermedad es leucemia linfocitica aguda.<br />
            The other phases of treatment for ALL are the initial induction phase, and then the consolidation or intensification phase. These are fase de inducción y fase de consolidación o intensificación respectively.

            If a patient does not understand a question it is not our job to rephrase it. Just interpret their response and the provider will decide how to respond just as they would in an encounter with a patient who shares their language.
            <br />
            Plus, our rephrased question may very well not be accurate.
            <br />
            If the patient didn't hear you then you can repeat the same question but don't rephrase.
        </p>

            Vitreous floaters are clumps of debris in the vitreous fluid inside the eye. The debris clumps together and causes the patient to see spots in their visual field. The spots the patient sees are called opacities.
            <br />
            In Spanish vitreous floaters is flotadores vítreos, vitreous liquid is liquido vítreo, and opacity is opacidad.
        </p>


        <p>
            blood type and cross is a blood test done to determine blood type and compatability. In Spanish it is determinación del group sanguineo y pruebas cruzadas.
        </p>

        <p>
            Screening test is prueba de detección, complete blood count (CBC) is conteo sanguineo completo, and <br />complete metabolic panel (CMP) is panel metabólico completo.

            It is okay to verify information before delivering your interpretation. <br />
            I encourage you to do so if you have any doubt about the information.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before you verify remember to let the other person know what you are doing in order to maintain transparency.

            A nasogastric tube (commonly known as a feeding tube) is a thin plastic tube inserted in the nose and passed down the esophagus to the stomach to deliver food (total parenteral nutrition) or to remove stomach contents. It is not typically used long term. For long term TPN a gastrostomy tube (g-tube) is used. This is a tube that is surgically inserted directly into the stomach or intestine. A percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube is the same but specifies that an endoscope is used to insert the tube through the skin. The endoscope helps the surgeon to accurately place the tube.
            <br />
            In Spanish the terms are respectively:
            <br />
            Sonda nasogastrica (Sonda de alimentación)
            Nutrición parenteral total (NPT)
            Gastrostomía
            Gastrostomía endoscópica percutánea

            Dizziness and vertigo are not the same. Vertigo refers specifically to the sensation that the room is spinning. Dizziness is usually used to describe lightheadedness or the sensation that you are going to pass out. Both sensations are often associated with balance problems.
            <br />
            It is important to correctly interpret each term. Vertigo has fewer causes than dizziness and therefore helps narrow down the diagnosis more than dizziness. It is a more specific symptom.
            <br />
            When asking patients about vertigo providers usually ask the patient if they feel like they are spinning or that the room is spinning because vertigo is not a term that everyone is familiar with.
            <br />
            Dizziness is mareos and vertigo is vértigo. To ask if the patient feels like the room is spinning  I usually say, "se siente como si el cuarto estuviera dando vueltas?"
        </p>

        <p>
            Reminder:
            <br />
            ventricle = ventrículo
            atrium = aurícula
            <br />
            Aurícula is the medical term. Atrio refers to the atrium of a building and is not used to refer to the atriums of the heart.
        </p>

            A graft is a procedure where tissue is taken from a spot on a person's body or from a cadaver and
            <br />
            place on an injury site to repair it without taking the blood vessels.
            <br />
            A flap is similar except the blood vessels of the graft tissue are taken along with the tissue.
            <br />
            Graft is injerto, flap is colgajo.

            Jaundice occurs when the liver does not metabolize bilirubin correctly. The patient's skin and eyes become yellow due to the yellow pigment in the bilirubin.
            <br />
            Jaundice is ictericia, and bilirubin is bilirubina.
        </p>
        <p>

            Near sightedness(myopy) is miopía, far sightedness(hypermetropy) is hipermetropía and Astigmatism os astigmatismo.
            <br />
            Optic nerve is nervio óptico, pupil is púpila, conjunctiva is conjuntiva, cornea is córnea, iris is the same, macula is mácula, and eyes lens is lente del ojo.
            <br />
            Retinopathy is retinopatía, glaucoma is the same, retinal detachment is desprendimiento retinal, and macular degeneration is degeneración macular.
            <br />
            Optic nerve block is bloqueo del nervio óptico.

            As an interpreter you end up delivering lots of bad news and telling many sad stories.
            <br />
            It has an effect on us and its important to have a way to cope with these experiences.
            <br />
            Working at a large teaching hospital I have interpreted so many seriously sad and difficult situations. I see a counselor once a month to talk about them.
            <br />
            It helps to talk about the events (respecting HIPAA of course) and how they made you feel. If you do not express your feelings in some way medical interpreting can be very damaging to your mental health.
            <br />
            If you ever need to talk to someone about your experiences I am available.

            Ideally providers would always speak in 2-3 sentence phrases at an even pace, pause for you, and wait for the patient to respond in the same manner allowing you to interpet.
            <br />
            Unfortunately we don't live in an ideal world: people talk out of turn, talk fast, talk without pausing(not what we want in consecutive mode), talk over one another, and speak before hearing the question/answer. It can be very frustrating.
            <br />
            A lot of this is beyond our control, but there are things we can do to help mange the flow of communication. Asking the speaker to pause more frequently is one example. We can also ask for the speaker to wait until we finish rendering our interpretation before continuing. And you will frequently have to remind speakers to talk in first person and directly to the other speaker.
            <br />
            Anytime you intervene be sure that you inform both parties. For example if you are going to ask the doctor to say 2-3 sentences and pause you should tell the patient that this is what you are going to do. Or viceversa, if you plan to ask the patient to speak in first person then tell the doctor first. This maintains transparency and avoids either party losing trust in the other.
            <br />
            If either person questions the need for this you can tell them that it is to improve accuracy and efficiency.
            <br />
            I recommend that you read the NCIHC ethics and standards booklet to learn more about managing the flow of communication and maintaining transparency.

        </p>

            Strive to interpret the meaning of a message and not just the words. A great way to understand what that means is to listen to interpretations of songs and movies.

            Intoxicado does not mean the same as intoxicated. It means poisoned. Intoxicated means to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
            <br />
            If you have not read about the case of Willie Ramirez I recommend that you do. It made the need for trained medical interpreters apparent, and the mistakes made teach valuable lessons about how careful we must be when interpreting.

            It is not a good idea to be alone in a room with a patient. A good rule of thumb is to leave the room when the provider leaves the room, even if they will only be out for a short period of time.
            <br />
            The main reason for this is to avoid the patient asking you medical questions. You should never answer medical questions, always interpret the questions to the provider even if you know the answer. If you answer the question with your knowledge you risk giving misinformation and endangering the patient; also, you take away the providers opportunity to explain more thoroughly anything that remains unclear and that too can negatively affect the patients care.
            <br />
            Second, you risk the patient telling you information they want kept private from the doctor. If this information is important for the patient's care that puts you in a tricky situation: you have to tell the doctor to avoid the patient's care being affected, but you will then upset the patient for betraying their trust.
            <br />
            Third, you may be accused of saying or doing something to the patient and it being just the two of you it will be their word against yours.

            Try to avoid wearing clothes that call a lot of attention. Dress according to the code in your workplace, but do what you can to not stand out during an interpretation: the goal is for the patient and provider to look at eachother not at you.

            Latin America is very linguistically diverse. Not everyone speaks Spanish or Portuguese. There are thousands of indigenous languages still in use.
            <br />
            For example, at the hospital where I work there are lots of patients that speak one of the many Mayan languages as their primary language.
            <br />
            If you have doubts about your patient's proficiency in the language you interpret you should ask the patient if they speak another language. <br />If so then arrange for an interpreter in their language.
            <br />
            Even if they speak some of the language you interpret, do not proceed in that language.

            Every time you hear a new term write it down and look up the translation.
            <br />
            Download Linguee on your phone. If you do not have a phone carry a Span-Eng Medical terms dictionary.
            <br />
            It is okay to look up a term while you are in a session. Let the provider and patient know that you don't know the translation and that you will quickly look it up. <br />If you are embarassed remember that it is a lot more embarassing and dangerous to skip the word or say the wrong term.
